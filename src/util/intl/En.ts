Throughout my studies, I collaborated on various projects such as Datafound, Datawatch, and Changer, companies where I developed innovative technologies. These experiences prepared me for the job market by honing skills in areas such as software design, analysis, development, debugging, testing, and distributed implementation. Along this journey, I also developed self-awareness and improved my soft skills, including teamwork, communication, proactivity, feedback, and management. I worked as an intern at Dock Tech, a financial processing fintech, where I had the opportunity to sharpen my critical and analytical thinking by addressing financial transaction issues through technological solutions. I collaborated with incredible professionals, enriching my professional experience. In 2024, I contributed to developing the rules required by Visa, ensuring compliance within the card industry. Furthermore, I strive to connect not only with people in Brazil but also with the global technology community. To achieve this, I leverage my English skills as a tool to explore new horizons and expand my reach, constantly practicing my knowledge in languages, programming, analysis, and management."
