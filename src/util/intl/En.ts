Throughout my undergraduate studies, I collaborated on various projects, microservices, and the full development of a hardcoded AI chatbot, where I developed innovative technologies. These experiences prepared me for the job market in techniques that cover everything from software design, analysis, development, debugging, testing, and distributed implementation. During this journey, I also developed self-awareness and refined my soft skills, such as teamwork, communication, proactivity, feedback, and management. I worked as an intern at the big tech company Stefanini, where I had the opportunity to sharpen my critical and analytical thinking, solving issues related to financial transactions with technological solutions. I worked alongside incredible people, enriching my professional experience. In addition, I aim not only to reach people in Brazil but also to connect with the global tech community. For this, I use my English as a tool to explore new horizons and expand my impact, constantly practicing my knowledge in languages, programming, analysis, and management."
